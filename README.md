# secure-ai-docs

Monorepo containing frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript) and backend (Node + Express + TypeScript).

All files are placeholders to be implemented in subsequent steps.

Root scripts:

- npm run dev — runs frontend and backend concurrently (requires installing root dev deps)
- npm run build — builds both apps
